    Hi, I'm Victoria and I live in Halifax, Canada. But I've been traveling
    around the world for many years and my passion stays the same - I'm in love
    with the finest porcelain: cups, teapots, vintage lifestyle and fashions.

description: I'm collecting cups, read old cooking magazines, prepare and print
  postcards for your enjoyment.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
